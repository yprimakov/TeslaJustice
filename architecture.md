# TeslaJustice Social Media Monitoring Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture for the TeslaJustice application, which will automatically monitor social media platforms for reports of vandalism against Tesla vehicles and properties, analyze the content using AI, and aggregate this information into a centralized database.

## System Components

### 1. Social Media Integration Layer
- **Twitter/X API Integration**
  - Monitor hashtags (#TeslaJustice) and mentions (@TeslaJustice)
  - Search for keywords ("tesla vandalism", "cybertruck damage", etc.)
  - Collect media content (videos, images) and text
  - Track conversation threads for updates

- **Future Platform Integrations**
  - Instagram
  - Facebook
  - YouTube
  - Reddit
  - TikTok

### 2. AI Analysis Pipeline
- **Content Classification**
  - Determine if content relates to Tesla vandalism
  - Categorize type of vandalism (graffiti, physical damage, etc.)
  - Filter out false positives and irrelevant content

- **Media Analysis**
  - Video content analysis to identify vandalism acts
  - Image recognition to detect damage types
  - License plate recognition (with privacy controls)
  - Location identification from visual cues

- **Text Analysis**
  - Natural language processing to extract incident details
  - Entity recognition (locations, dates, people)
  - Sentiment analysis to gauge public reaction

- **Summary Generation**
  - Create concise headlines for incidents
  - Generate detailed summaries of events
  - Extract key details (location, time, damage type)

### 3. Case Management System
- **Case Creation**
  - Automatic case generation from verified incidents
  - Deduplication to link multiple reports of same incident
  - Case status tracking (reported, identified, prosecuted, etc.)

- **Update Monitoring**
  - Continuous tracking of case-related posts
  - Automatic updates when new information appears
  - Timeline view of case progression

- **Entity Linking**
  - Connect related incidents by location, method, or suspects
  - Pattern recognition across multiple cases
  - Suspect identification and tracking (with privacy controls)

### 4. Data Storage Layer
- **Supabase Database**
  - Cases table (core incident information)
  - Media table (links to evidence)
  - Updates table (case progression)
  - Sources table (original social media posts)
  - Analytics table (trends and statistics)

- **Media Storage**
  - S3-compatible storage for video/image evidence
  - Cached copies of social media content
  - Processed media with analysis metadata

### 5. User Interface
- **Public Dashboard**
  - Map view of incidents
  - Case browsing and filtering
  - Detailed case views with evidence
  - Trend visualization and statistics

- **Admin Interface**
  - Case management tools
  - Content moderation
  - System monitoring and configuration
  - Analytics and reporting

## Data Flow

1. **Collection Phase**
   - Social media APIs continuously monitored for relevant content
   - New posts matching criteria are queued for analysis
   - Media content is downloaded and stored

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - AI pipeline processes queued content
   - Classification determines relevance
   - Media and text analyzed for incident details
   - Summary and headline generated

3. **Case Management Phase**
   - New incidents create cases or update existing ones
   - Deduplication algorithms link related reports
   - Case status updated based on new information
   - Related cases linked through entity recognition

4. **Presentation Phase**
   - Processed data displayed on public dashboard
   - Notifications sent for significant updates
   - Analytics generated for trends and patterns
   - Reports available for download

## Technical Implementation
